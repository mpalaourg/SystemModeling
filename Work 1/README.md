# System Simulation and Modeling 1st Assignment, AUTh [2018]
> Estimate unknown parameters using Least Squares Method.

<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "System Simulation and Modeling" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2018.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The goal of this assignment was to estimate unknown parameters, where:
<ul>
<li> Task 1: Find k, m, b in a mass - spring - damper system. </li>
<li> Task 2: Find RC, LC in a RLC circuit. </li>
</ul>
using the Least Squares method.
