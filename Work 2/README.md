# System Simulation and Modeling 2nd Assignment, AUTh [2018]
> Estimate unknown parameters in real time.

<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "System Simulation and Modeling" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2018.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The goal of this assignment was to estimate unknown parameters in real time, using two methods:
<ul>
<li>  Slope Estimation Method, </li>
<li>  Lyapunov Method:
  <ul>
    <li> Parallel Model, </li>
    <li> Series-Parallel Model.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
