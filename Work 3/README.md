# System Simulation and Modeling 3rd Assignment, AUTh [2018]
> Estimate unknown parameters using Slope Estimation Method with Projection.

<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "System Simulation and Modeling" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2018.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The goal of this assignment was to estimate unknown parameters using the Projection Operator Pr{.}. Projection is not an independent parameter estimation method, but is applied in addition to other estimation methods, in order to adapt the retroactive law that governs them, to the constraints imposed by the particular problem.
